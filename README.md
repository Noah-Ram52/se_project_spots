# Project 9: Spots

```
Project 9 involves using API and how I am involving index.js with my Api.js.
```

## Description of Project 3

1. Api.js : .

2. index.js : Linked all files to the CSS, so they are applied.
3. Using npm : Using a blocks folder to seperate CSS files for faster loading time.

4. Webpack: Using webpack.config.js for building the server

### Improvements

1.  To improve what I know about CSS to know how it affect other CSS propertys.
2.  Knowing which CSS property to use and where to place it for the right declaration.
3.  Learning how to use CSS properties and declarations properly.
